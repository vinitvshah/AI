        "[LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a data framework for LLM applications.\n",
        "You can get started with just a few lines of code and build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system in minutes.\n",

        "### Financial Analysis over 10-K documents\n",
        "A key part of a financial analyst's job is to extract information and synthesize insight from long financial documents.\n",
        "A great example is the 10-K form - an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that gives a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance.\n",
        "These documents typically run hundred of pages in length, and contain domain-specific terminology that makes it challenging for a layperson to digest quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We showcase how LlamaIndex can support a financial analyst in quickly extracting information and synthesize insights **across multiple documents** with very little coding."
